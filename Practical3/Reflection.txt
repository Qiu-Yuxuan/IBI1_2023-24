During this course, I have learnt version control, how to navigate Unix-like systems and how to write simple programs in Python.

I have also learnt to write careful instructions when communicating online! 
I didn't finish the task during the course and  spend a lot of time after class.
I met a lot of problems in this process, but I overcome them.
